# Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis


This project mainly focuses on exploratory data analysis or EDA, which is a significant role in any analysis of a given dataset. It aids in the identification of any missing data, trends and relationships between features. It was a good practice for me to apply what has been learnt thus far. This includes application of statistics using scipy.stats, usage of Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy as well as data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
