# Capstone Project: Healthcare - Prediction of Stroke in US Patients

 

This project focuses on the healthcare components in predicting stroke in patients and how it could greatly reduce the fiscal burden on the healthcare sector as it is highly preventable. This dataset is heavily imbalanced and also contains missing values. Though I've domain expertise in life sciences, it still posed a challenge for me as to how I should deal with the missing values. This project includes the application of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning modeling as I visualized for any underlying trends and outliers and created models for predicting stroke in the patients. Throughout this project, I have encountered several limiting factors such as the number of features provided in the dataset. Although feature engineering and extraction were carried out, it failed to create models to at least obtain 0.1 score for precision. As this is dealing with matters of life and death, I focused on precision (to reduce false positives), recall (to reduce false negatives) and F1 scores instead of accuracy.
