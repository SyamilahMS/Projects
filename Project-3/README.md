# Project 3: Regression and Classification Practice using Ames Housing Data


This project mainly focuses on the application of supervised machine learning models through regression and classification and model evaluation. It also includes the use of feature engineering and extraction where necessary. It also emphasizes on performing thorough EDA on the dataset in identifying any missing data, trends and relationships between the features. 

There were 2 questions to be answered:

1-  To estimate the value of the homes from fixed characteristics of a home such as total basement square feet and lot area.

2- Determine the value of the modifiable characteristics of a home towards the pricing values.
